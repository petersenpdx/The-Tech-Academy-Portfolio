# Arroy Pet Thai (HTML and CSS)
## Overview
This is a project I created at The Tech Academy, a coding boot camp in downtown Portland, Oregon where I am a current student. I entered a starter framework for the CSS and adjusted the content to look like a basic website a local food cart might use. 

## Objective
Create a static HTML web page using CSS for style and simple animations. 

## Steps Taken
First I wrote up an outline of my ideas for the project. From there I typed in the skeleton code and adjusted the content to match my theme. I had to do extra research at several points to de-bug my code as the animations became more complex. The hardest struggle was getting the menu bars (with animation) to sit on top of my “menu” gallery. I was able to identify the property that was causing the problem and adjust the way I had written the code so that it displayed the way I wanted. 

## Result
I am especially proud of the code reviewing skills I learned while cleaning up the animation bugs to get the “menu” gallery to display with the subtle animation required for the project. Every new project I do, I find I am able to spot coding errors faster and faster. See the final site in action [here](https://filedn.com/lWYjvlpRciYBP9xzzyqgShB/Arroy%20Pet%20Thai/index.html).

## Future Features
This project represents the culmination of my intro to HTML and CSS course. I hope that after my upcoming practice with JavaScript I can come back to add a light box feature to the menu photos, as well as some pricing information in an interactive display.
