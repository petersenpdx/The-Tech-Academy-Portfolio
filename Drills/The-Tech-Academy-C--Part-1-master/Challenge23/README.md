# Asset Tracker
In this challenge I had a set of business requirements to fulfill and in order to test my knowledge of arrays, I needed to complete the application with only arrays. There are more efficient ways to build out the functionality being requested here, but the challenge really made me think through some new ways to use two dimensional arrays to store and retrieve data. In the end, I was able to get everything working, taking in user data for the two numerical categories and storing it in arrays so that I could perform .Sum() and .Average() operations on these sets of data.
