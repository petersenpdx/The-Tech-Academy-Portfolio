# SQL Drills
This is a database and a set of drills I completed in TSQL. Feel free to take a look through the files, if you are working with any queries from the "zoo" database, make sure to run the create_zoo_database file first!

## DRILL 1:
Compose a SELECT statement that queries for the following information
* All information from the habitat table.
## DRILL 2:
Compose a SELECT statement that queries for the following information:
* Retrieve all names from the species_name column that have a species_order value of 3.
## DRILL 3:
Compose a SELECT statement that queries for the following information:
* Retrieve only the nutrition_type from the nutrition table that have a nutrition_cost of 600.00 or less.
## DRILL 4:
Compose a SELECT statement that queries for the following information:
* Retrieve all species_names with the nutrition_id between 2202 and 2206 from the nutrition table.
## DRILL 5:
Compose a SELECT statement that queries for the following information:
* Retrieve all names within the species_name column using the alias "Species Name:" from the species table and their corresponding nutrition_type under the alias "Nutrition Type:" from the nutrition table.
## DRILL 6:
Compose a SELECT statement that queries for the following information:
* From the specialist table, retrieve the first and last name and contact number of those that provide care for the penguins from the species table.
## DRILL 7:
Create your own table. Build a select statement that queries for the following information:
* Create a database with two tables. Assign a foreign key constraint on one table that shares related data with the primary key on the second table. Finally, create a statement that queries data from both tables.
