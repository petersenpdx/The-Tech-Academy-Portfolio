//EXERCISE:
//IN A CONSOLE APP, CREATE CODE THAT DOES THE FOLLOWING:
//1. Create an interface called IQuittable and have it define a void method called Quit().
//2. Have your Employee class from the previous drill inherit that interface and implement 
//the Quit() method in any way you choose.
//3. Use polymorphism to create an object of type IQuittable and call the Quit() method on it.
//Hint: an object can be of an interface type if it implements that specific interface.

namespace Interface
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Employee human = new Employee();
            human.firstName = "Sample";
            human.lastName = "Student";
            human.SayName();

            IQuittable example = new Employee();
            example.Quit();

            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }
}
