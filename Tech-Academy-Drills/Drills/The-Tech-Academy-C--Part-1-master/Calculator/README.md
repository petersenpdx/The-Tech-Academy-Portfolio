# Basic Calculator

## Objective
Build a simple calculator using Visual C# webforms that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide two integers. There are tiny formatting requirements as well, like the font for the text entry fields and a background color for the result field.

## Steps Taken
I started with a new Visual C# webforms project and added in some webform elements using the design editor. From there I went in and wrote out the logic for the addition function, compiling and testing it in Chrome. Once I confirmed the addition logic would work, I adjusted it and applied a version to the other functions. 

## Results
The final calculator meets the project requirements. I was able to practice taking in data and manipulating data types in C# so that I could perform math functions and output results. This helped me learn some new methods and I can see how the build-test-improve workflow works in Visual Studio for a compiled language. Take a look at some of the logic [here](https://gist.github.com/jhunschejones/9cbfdef01f23c700b02b4149a2007f59).
