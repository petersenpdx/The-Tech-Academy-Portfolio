# The-Tech-Academy-Portfolio
Portfolio of projects completed at The Tech Academy bootcamp from October 2018 to  (HTML, CSS, T-SQL, Node.js, C#)

## Overview
From October 2018 to January 2019 I studied at The Tech Academy, a software development boot camp and licensed career school in Portland, Oregon. During the program I worked on several projects of varying scales to build my skills in HTML, CSS, SQL, JavaScript, C#, and the .NET framework. I also applied the learning skills I gained from these topics to the Node.js/Javascript stack, building several more web applications on my own to further my knowledge. Below is an overview of the projects I created during the program. Some are housed in this catch-all repository and several of the larger projects have their own repositories. Thank you for taking the time to look through my code, I am always trying my hardest to grow and improve my skills and I welcome any and all feedback you may have.
