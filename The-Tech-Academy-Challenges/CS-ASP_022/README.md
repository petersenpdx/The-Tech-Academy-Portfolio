# Flight Prices Exercise

In this exercise we used user input from radio buttons to access a two dimensional array and return prices for pretend flights between two locations. Two challenges I enjoyed about this exercise were creating conditional logic for when a user selects the same "from" and "to" cities, and researching different ways to format strings into currency values so the result would show in USD.
